# |  use special key word '^imports' to import other yaml config files in 
# |  current yaml document
# |  imports must be uniq and a direct child of root node
# |  imported files are injected as mapping nodes at top document level
# |  so you cannot use keys that already exists in the document
^imports :
    # you can redefine default import path with the special key '^path'
    # if you do not use it, the default path value will be the current directory
    # redefined path values are relative to the current directory (if a relative path 
    # is provided)
    ^path : ./config
    # you can also define any other var by prefixing key with ~
    ^dir  : subdir
    # and use it enclosed by ^
    # here final test path will be "./config/subdir/test.yml"
    test  : ^dir^/test.yml 
    # here final db path will be "./config/db.yml"
